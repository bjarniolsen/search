## Frontend dokumentation

All frontend files are located in /static folder.
Frontend is build with Nodejs module Gulp and configuration is placed in `gulpfile.js` and `package.json`.

### Build tool
(Grunt / Gulp / Mindscape / Compass)

To use Gulp you need Node JS
[Install Node.js](http://nodejs.org "Node JS website")

Then run this in your favorite commandline tool:
```
c:\path\to\project\root\folder> npm install
```

And wait for Nodejs package manager (npm) to install all dependent modules (package.json)

Then run this:
```
c:\path\to\project\root\folder\ > gulp
```

Gulp 'watches' file changes and builds Less and JS.

### CSS
(Sass / Less)
Less is located in /static/less/ and Gulp builds it to /static/dist/
CSS is Minified.

Remember to describe any Less/Sass specific structures and wizardry that is not obvious.

### Javascript
(jQuery / Other)
JS is located in /static/js/ and Gulp builds it to /static/dist/js/
JS is Uglify'ed.
